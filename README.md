### Description of the project
#### First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.

- This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

- Each task is linked and will help you to:

    + put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your + future instances
    + create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
    + create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel
    + create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
    + create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
